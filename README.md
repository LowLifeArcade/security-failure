## System Command Options

  > We need to cancel cron jobs and override diff check teardowns before they corrupt and burn up the data hives!
  
  #### Your job
  > You're a new hire and training was sparse. Sorry. Open the sequencer and use the `sysCmd` function to send system commands to shut down the systems safely.
  #### How To Succeed
  > Use `auto complete` by either pressing cmd + i (ctrl + i on PC... I think) or opening a quote. Hover over the function to get some information to go off of.

  #### Extra Credit
  > Once you safely shut down the system, build guards in the `sysCmd` function against wrong attempts for the future!
