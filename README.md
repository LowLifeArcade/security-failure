# * ### Security Failure ###*
## System Command Options

  > We need to run cron jobs and cancel dif resets before they corrupt our security structures protecting our data hives!
  
  #### Your job
  > You're a new hire and training was sparse. Sorry. Under each instruction use the `sysCmd` function to send system commands to shut down the systems in a safe way.
  #### How To Succeed
  > Use `auto complete` by either pressing cmd i (ctrl i on PC... I think) or opening a string quote. Hover over the function to get some good information to go off of. For instance, the second argument for sysCmd is an object. You'll have to open an object to get the autocomplete working there.

  #### Extra Credit
  >Once you safely shut down the system, build guards in the `sysCmd` function against wrong attempts for future devs!
