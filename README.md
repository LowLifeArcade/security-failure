# * ### Security Failure ### *
## ðŸ”¥ ðŸš¨ ALERT ðŸš¨ ðŸ”¥

  The systems are in MELTDOWN. We need to cancel cron jobs, override the overdrives, and diff all the checks to cool down the systems before they corrupt!
  
  #### Your job
  > You're a new hire and training was sparse. Sorry. You can get to the 800 page manual tomorrow. For now, when you're ready, `press the period key and open sequencer.js` and send system commands to shut down the systems safely.
  #### How To Succeed
  > Use `auto complete` by either pressing cmd + i (ctrl + i on PC... I think) or opening a quote. Hover over the function to get some information. (That'll make up for your training ðŸ‘€).

  #### Extra Credit
  > Once you safely shut down the systems, build guards in the `sysCmd` function against wrong attempts for the future!

  ## Press the period key to start, then open sequencer.js
